# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

This repository contains code for a neural network model that performs digit classification on the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

This project implements a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, OpenCV (cv2), PIL, TensorFlow, Keras

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/MNIST-Digit-Classification-with-Neural-Network.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn opencv-python-headless Pillow
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the neural network model for digit classification.

## Files

- `mnist_digit_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for digit classification using a neural network.
- `data/`: Directory containing the MNIST dataset downloaded from [Keras Datasets](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/).

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains a large number of images of handwritten digits along with their respective labels. The neural network model aims to accurately classify these digits based on the images.
